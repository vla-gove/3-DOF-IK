# 3DOF-IK
Calculating Inverse Kinematics of a 3-DOF Robot Manipulator (RRR) in C

Includes a Robot structure for a theoretical 3 degrees of freedom robot manipulator with all rotational joints, and an inverse kinematics function which return robot's joint parameters based on the end effector's position.
